Learning Curve:

Application

Devops 
Basics




Application:Set of programs 
to manage app we need Datacenter but as our apps are very big on premise data centers are not sufficient to manage app
and we are moving to cloud data center to manage infrastructure 

Application should  satisfy few conditions:

fast delivery
higher quality
less spending
always available:eg customer care

eg:swiggy,zepto,dunzo..


DevOps:It is amethod or culture to develop app for faster delivery with high quality and less time and always available
It is a set of tools to manage and establish CI/CD pipeline 
Withe the help of CI/CD pipeline we are going to deliver our app rapidly

Practice daily for 2-3 hrs

How to manage scripting using Groovy
Json
Scripting
YAML 
 




To manage application we will be using data center or cloud data center

that app is organised by set of computers
these computers are going to be associated with different type of components and they will manage application 

Technology used to manage their application:Cloud technology

AWS
Azure
Gcp
IBM
Oracle


Road Map:

DevOps:set of practices that combine software development and it operations.It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle 
and provide continous delivery with high quality software.
