Basics




Application:Set of programs 
to manage app we need Datacenter but as our apps are very big on premise data centers are not sufficient to manage app
and we are moving to cloud data center to manage infrastructure 

Application should  satisfy few conditions:

fast delivery
higher quality
less spending
always available:eg customer care

eg:swiggy,zepto,dunzo..


DevOps:It is amethod or culture to develop app for faster delivery with high quality and less time and always available
It is a set of tools to manage and establish CI/CD pipeline 
Withe the help of CI/CD pipeline we are going to deliver our app rapidly

To manage application we will be using data center or cloud data center

that app is organised by set of computers
these computers are going to be associated with different type of components and they will manage application 

Technology used to manage their application:Cloud technology

AWS

Why AWS Cloud 
Store Information of aws account/AWS Certification as well
AWS Account
Terms

AWS:Global Infrastructure
We can host/launch our app wherever we want
And it is categorized into 31 regions
Geo locations are regions
First Geo location is 'North Virginia'
India:two geo locations
 Mumbai
 Hyderabad

99 AVilability Zones(Datacenters)
Data centers:set of servers stored in warehouse in the form of racks

There are 3 data centers in Mumbai

Edge locations:like cell phone towers

AWS is more flexible and scalable

Scalability:scaling up and down
Elasticity:

Security Layer
AWS Account

Q.How to login with Root account
Q.What is the use of root use, diff between IAM VS Root user
  Root user has full access of resources and services
  

MFA:Multi Factor Authentication

Creating IAM user

We can also attach or dettach permission for IAM users through Root user login

EC2,

EC2:To perform computing in cloud Tech in AWS service  ec2 is used
EC2:Elastic Cloud computer

I we want to launch instance the prerequisites are
AMI:Amazon Machine Image
Template that contains the software configuration (os,app server and apps) req to launch instance

1.OS Version
2.Instance Type
   t2
   t3

3.Volumes :EBS
4.Keypair(.pem/ppk)
  Keypair login (info) :Secure connection to AMI
  One KP can be used mlp times with AMI Templates


Keypairs are unique but one keypair can be used same template for of multiple files

Security Group:It is like one of the port

Port no's allows to launch machines 
SSH for amazon
RDP for windows

Freq used ports to launch ec2 machines
21:FTP
22:SSH
23:TELNET
80:WEB
53:DNS
161:SNMP

Port mo means protocol
IP Address
 private IP addres:connecting servers , to establish connection between two servers we need private ip
 public ip address
 


  




Q.What is EC2
Q.What is the nameof ec2 server
Q.AMI

In ec2 server are called as instances


Instances once terminated cant be used but one pem file can be used for multiple instances with same template 



Instance type we are using
what is t2.micro:isntance type
general purpose: ebs
And why t2.micro
what are different types of instance types we are using  and can we use for real time apps
and we cant use t2.micro for real time

Name of hard disk:volumes
service name is called:ebs elastic block storage

What is security group:port no
if we launch linux machine what is the port no and what is the protocol
SSH, 22
If we want to launch instance what is the status check need to pass:2/2 check
what is 1/2 and what is 2/2?
what is the status of instance when it is ready to connect:running

one security group can be used for multiple ami's 
when we create new instance every time it will asks for security group as well we can use old security group or else we can create other

what is the use of private ip:it is used to connect two instances
public ip :is used for we can access this public ip for users 

AMI:Template that consiist software configuration
And hardware configuration in instance type
key pair is used for secure connection of instance 

computing device:instance type
t2.micro is one type of processor

How to store data: in the form of hard disk 

For storing data in computer :Hard disk
Here we rae using Hard disk as Volumes that is EBS 

Key Pair:

if we want to install os as windows we need keys so we will be generating keys and that key pair is in the form of (.pem)
we can also use .ppk 
once kay pair can be used for multiple ami's
key pair:secure connection for ami and one key pair can be used for multiple times with same ami template
pem file is in the form of keypair 

Security Group:It is very imp to launch ami's
security group means port's
diff ports for diff machines
amazon:ssh port
windows machine:rdp port
port no:allows to launch machine 

2/2 checks means allocating hardware to resources and loading ami to the server


Instance states

Pending
Running 
Stopping
Stopped
Shutting Down
Terminate


1/1:Hardware allocation
2/2:Software Allocation


Mobaxterm
git bash
putty 
we can use any above of those external softwares through pem file and will launch ec2 instance (Virtualization layer is launched)


sudo yum install httpd:to install Apache Tomcatapp
whcih httpd:shows location
service httpd status:to check status 

system ctl status:shows status 

sudo service httpd start
start httpd.service

sudo service httpd reload
service httpd reload

sudo chkconfig httpd on

sudo service disable httpd:to disable te service
sudo yum remove httpd -y: to remove the service 


service/systemctl/chkconfig :All are similar

sudo service httpd stop:to stop the service 

system ctl:service in linux to start packages
This is a kind of service in the linux.By using this service we can start the services like 

ngnix
jenkins
http
ansible

WebServer:Taking the req from the client and redirecting the service like httpd 

Bootstarp script


App is hosted by ec2 instance 

 HTTP:80
HTTPS:443

One security group can be used multiple times for any type of linux machine

Inbound rule:Trffic towrds ec2 machine
Outbond rule:traffic which is going outside from ec2 

for inbound rules we need to enable ports and it is not required for outbond 
for outbond we need to choose All traffic(means TCP)



App server:

Web server:takes req from client and we are going to redirecting the service like httpd

Booting:In this process some instructions some programs 

process of loading some instructions while swtiching on the system 

Loading Boostrap script:



In windows we have xecutables files .exe :examples:java, vlc layer,python
softwares are packages :git,maven,jenkins,dockers,python,java,tomcat

YUM:yellowdog update modifier
YUM is a command it is an open source 
All kind of packages which we need for daily jobs 
package management utility 

If we want to install any sofware in linux we need to install package YUM
apt-get :is also same for it is used for UBUNTU

sudo yum install tree -y:we can see entire structure of installed and created files

whoami:shows the current user

Command to find the Hostname:hostname
ifconfig:to check ip addresss and complete data of instance
hostname -i:only displays private ip address

which mvn
which git

to find out exact location of software package

echo:to print 

web server:install httpd
           start the service 

sudo kill -SIGKILL 27812  :to kill processor 

sudo systemctl status httpd:to check the status 
sudo yum install httpd -y:to install
 sudo systemctl start httpd



==================================================================================

Cloud watch:To monitor resources which is associated with APP/Nw

Two types of monitoring 
Default--for free tier
Detail--for billable 

It is associated with SNS and Metrics 

We have couple of metrices like

SNS and Metrics (resources id)
CPU utilization
Disk Read and write OPS
Network IN & OUT 
Alaram: 3 states


CloudWatch:

This is integrated service of AWS

we will be pushing cloud watch to two difeerent types of tools one is Splunk and the other one is data dog
we can also trigger the alaram as well




Git:Session

Git 
Git Hub
Git bash

Opensource tol, dsitributed vcs 

Maven:Build Tool

some of the build tools are

ANT
Gradle
Jfrog
Maven

By using tjese buld in tools artifacts are generated
Artifacts:.war files, jar files, zip files 

All files togehther can be sent as Artifacts if we send as artifacts then no one can destory our source code 

By using these Mavne we can achieve Vulnerability. Means trust between each and every file

Maven:open source tool
It has maven repository
It also has POM.XML file it contains two things one is plugins and dependecies


Maven is for generating Artifacts

In Maven using commands generate Jar files that contains POM.xml file once it is done 

once jar file is created we need to create war file 

war file --> git hub --> jenkins/ Docker/Kubernetes

First install mvn
Then check mvn version
Now give this command mvn archetype:generate and now after giving this command 
It runs for sometime and asks for portno give the port no 
and now it runs for sometime and then asks for version which one to install give the version
after choosing version it now asks for group name artifact id: give those names 
Now the Build will be success 
Now we need to compile it for this go to that file by using the command
 cd filename
Now give the command 
Mvn compile
After doing compile these files will be converted as POM.xml and source coude will be converted as class files

Now give the command MVN package:which creates jar files(This is the Artifact)

Now go to that folder and open git bash termianl
add those files to staging area and commit those to main branch 
and create one repo in remote 
and push these files to that repo

git push -u origin main 

Now tese jar files will be pushed to remote 




mvn archetype:generate -->taking sample project
cd --> compile --> mvn compile
mvn test --> convert  all class files (if more than 1)
mvn package --> data --> Artifact

Create one EC2 instance in windows and install Maven 


In order to launch windows rdp

create ec2 instance
now choose download RDP and create new key pair with RSA uisng .pemfile
and after downloading upload the diwnloaded pemfile to access the pw
and now use th provided pw and connect to rdp
install git in edge in rdp and then install of the req apps like mvn

Now as we have already generated jar files now we have to generate war files

jar files not suitable for TOMCAT server it needs war files 
In Jenkins/ dOcker/ K8'S we req WAR files 


Generating WAR file with Minimal Code:

.WAR file--> ARTIFACT 
for generating WAR file we req

IDE EDITOR(Eclipse, VS, Pycharm, Netbeans)
Java code 
Maven s/w in local system

Now install Eclipse and then open it and in New proj choose mvn project 
and follow the steps to generate WAR file

For the java code we need Serverlets and JSP code for that we can add dependencies of those 

Search for Mvane central Repository and then search for Java Servlet API 
choose he latest and take the script of the latest and addit to pom.xml file

similarly add JSP dependencies as well

Now after adding dependencies in the folder choose Maven Dependencies right click on it, build path, configure build path 
now give the package name and calss name now paste the code check the calss names and modify 

go to main folder right click and run as maven build now give the package name there and click on run to generate WAR file

JENKINS

Installation:

To maintain the flow of project we need Jenkins 
Jenkins is also for Testers, Developers 
need to estalish pipelines
we have to maintain the stream between GIT-->MVAEN-->JENKINS-->ANSIBLE-->AWS



By using Jenkins Tool we can build pipeline jobs 
There are also other aleternatives like openstack
We have choosed Jenkins as it is opensource, java based 
Here we are aintainng CI/CD Pipeline


CI/CD:Continous Integration, Continous Deployment
Eg:phonepe(adding multiplefeatures to it)

continous download
continous build
continous deploy
continous test  these comes under CI

Conitnous Deliverables

continous dev

 Continous Downalod:GIT
 Continous Build:Maven
Continous Deploy:Tomcat(Qa)
Continous Testing:Se, Junit

Continous Dev

continous Dev|:Tomcat(prod)
Manual/ Automate:Groovy



Scripting vs Programing

Programming:set of programs to perform tasks

we use prgramming lang's to develop apps
like java, sql, c, cpp

Scripting:To validate the things we use scripting 
It is light weight,means it won't consume more resources


Groovy Script:

We have dif scripting lang's

JSON
Python
SQL 
SHELL
Groovy
YAML


gROOVY:

It is OO lang, it allows reusability secure and easy to extend
It has Java syntax
It Integrates Objects -->Interface(Jenkins)
Agile(Jira)
